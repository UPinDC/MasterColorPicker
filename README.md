MasterColorPicker
=================

modern JavaScript powered color-picker delivering all the color you can handle

since GitHub installation crashed on my computer, 
files may not be "uploaded", 
only text files and no images may be in the database,
and tab-spaceing on displayed files is set to 8 dispite that I left it at the default 2,
go to my website to download the complete package.
When trying to update the files with bug fixes, GitHub doesn't even work on my browser.


What is here on GitHub is NO LONGER WORKING because it won't allow me to update all files...

no way to even keep track of how many downloads.
